that the first objective would be to have a simple page which the first thing that happens is that I can upload a parquet file and this will be loaded as a polar and there is going to be an error if it cannot be loaded as a polar frame and then I will have the possibility to select the columns that I want to visualize and to apply a slice operation so choosing the starting row index and the height of the slice.
