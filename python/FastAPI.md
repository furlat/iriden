FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It provides an easy way to build RESTful APIs that are highly performant and secure. FastAPI was created by Sebastian Ramirez and released in March 2018.

FastAPI is built upon several other libraries, including [[Starlette]] (a lightweight ASGI framework), [[Pydantic]] (for data validation and serialization/deserialization), and [[uvicorn]] (an ASGI server). FastAPI integrates these components to provide a powerful yet easy-to-use API development experience.

FastAPI's relationship with Pydantic is crucial, as it uses Pydantic for handling request bodies, query parameters, path parameters, and response data validation. Pydantic provides a way to define Python classes that represent the structure of your input/output data in a strongly-typed manner. This allows FastAPI to automatically validate incoming requests against these models and generate documentation based on them.

Here's an example of how you can use Pydantic with FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    return item
```

In this example, we define a Pydantic model `Item`, which represents the structure of our request body for creating an item in our API. The FastAPI route function `create_item` expects an instance of `Item` as its argument and returns it back to the client after some processing (in this case, just returning the input).

FastAPI automatically validates that the incoming JSON data matches the structure defined by the Pydantic model, ensuring that all required fields are present and have the correct types. This helps catch errors early in the development process and makes your API more robust against malformed requests.

In summary, FastAPI is a powerful web framework for building APIs with Python, leveraging the strengths of other libraries like Pydantic to provide strong typing, data validation, and automatic documentation generation. ak`
