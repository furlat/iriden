Pydanticv2 library in python 

Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library for Python. It provides tools to validate input data, define models with type hints, and serialize/deserialize objects into various formats like JSON or YAML. Pydantic v2 is the latest version of this library that brings several improvements over its predecessor.

Here's an example of how you can use Pydantic in Python:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., min_length=3)
    age: int = Field(None, gt=0, le=120)
    email: str | None = Field(None, regex="[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+")
```

In this example, we define a `User` model with three fields: `name`, `age`, and `email`. Each field has its own validation rules defined using the `Field()` function. For instance, the `name` field must be at least 3 characters long, the `age` field should be between 1 and 120 (inclusive), and the `email` field should match a specific regular expression pattern.

To validate an object against this model, you can simply create an instance of it:

```python
try:
    user = User(name="John", age=35, email="john@example.com")
except ValidationError as e:
    print(e)  # Outputs the validation errors if to JSON format
```

In this case, we create a `User` instance with valid data and then serialize it to JSON using the `json()` method provided by Pydantic models. If there were any validation errors (e.g., if

 we tried to set an invalid value for one of the fields), they would be caught during the instantiation process, and a `ValidationError` exception would be raised instead of returning valid JSON data. Here's an example:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

try:
    user = User(name="John Doe", age=30)  # valid data
except ValidationError as e:
    print("Validation error:", e.errors())
else:
    json_data = user.json()
    print("Serialized JSON data:", json_data)
```

In this example, we create a `User` instance with the name "John Doe" and age 30. Since these values are valid according to the model's schema, no validation errors occur, and the serialized JSON data is printed:

```
Serialized JSON data: {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}
```

If we were to provide invalid data (e.g., a non-integer value for `age`), a `ValidationError` would be raised, and the error messages would be printed instead of valid JSON data:

```python
try:
    user = User(name="John Doe", age="thirty")  # invalid data (non-integer age)
except ValidationError as e:
    print("Validation error:", e.errors())
else:
    json_data = user.json()
    print("Serialized JSON data:", json_data)
```

Output:

```
Validation error: [{'loc': ('age',), 'msg': 'value is not a valid integer', 'type': 'type_error.integer'}]
```
