Cynde is a project aimed at simplifying the utilization of large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and traditional data science techniques by addressing common challenges faced in this domain. The main issues encountered include handling state management, efficiently parallelizing LLM operations, validating choices related to language models, selecting appropriate embedding structures, and determining optimal prompts for tasks.

To tackle these problems, Cynde leverages [[Polars]] as an in-memory data structure that can also handle lazy queries on disk data. This allows for efficient multi-threaded processing of large datasets. Additionally, the project incorporates predictive models to validate choices made during LLM usage and optimize performance. The idea is to create a task where the input is correct, and the output is a function of uncertain choices. By measuring how these choices affect out-of-sample performance in the predictive task, one can determine their effectiveness.

Cynde focuses on embedding string data using two core operators: encoder language transformer models (embedders) and chat-instructed language models that map strings to other strings. The project also utilizes [[JSON]] string abstraction to treat strings as structured objects or entities, enabling entity-to-entity operations through categorical representations of reality.

Cynde then uses [[Scikit-Learn]] to learn classifiers that map from the various embedding and prompt choices to a target variable. This procedure is used to rank and evaluate algorithmic choices in an unbiased way using nested cross-validation. 

To ensure safety and stability in the system, Cynde employs [[Pydantic]] for validating models, strings, and custom logic using Python type hints. This allows users to define specific structures for language model output, effectively controlling the sampling process and extending machine learning capabilities. Furthermore, Cynde enables mapping data types, such as string columns in Polars, to categories through predictive models or embeddings via LLMs.

In summary, Cynde aims to streamline large language modeling tasks by addressing common challenges faced in this domain. By leveraging Polars for efficient processing and incorporating Pydantic for validation, the project provides a more intuitive approach to working with LLMs, embeddings, and traditional data science techniques.
