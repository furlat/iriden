Derived from [[Abstractions Chat with Enrica]]
I was discussing the idea of [[Abstractions]], particularly in relation to Leonardo Grant's project. My main concern is maintaining order within the space of tasks and abstractions being worked on. The problem arises from our belief that we can have ultra-simplified models for everything. We want language models to do it all but also expect them to be highly abstractable in a very simplistic way.

In reality, language models create arbitrary mappings between strings and strings. However, we've added the concept that these strings can be parsed into entities, categories, and relationships among them. The idea is that the mapping between this parsing of strings to categories should follow some structure, and JSON strings are a good candidate due to their prevalence in APIs and as structured data objects. [[Pydantic]] demonstrates how we can map concepts closer to our current understanding of classes, entities, and structures into JSON strings and thus back into strings.

We need to start building an objective taxonomy of these paid-ante classes. I have a conflict here because I think the right way is to try doing tasks, create the paid-ante classes needed for those tasks, and then find common ones across multiple tasks while generalizing and abstracting them. However, we've also learned that if one becomes obsessive about creating nested structures, it can be detrimental as it requires using a lot of unnecessary tokens to perform these operations.

Hierarchical abstractions are beneficial because when dealing with a paragraph, you only need to know which sentences are contained within and their representation without going any lower in the hierarchy. This hierarchical structure allows for different levels of semantic zooming - we can either see a chapter as a collection of paragraphs that are collections of sentences or just as a collection of sentences and paragraphs.

We've also considered thinking about language models not only as mappings between strings and categories but also as mappings between categories themselves. For example, a language model takes a "paragraph" category as input and outputs a transformed "paragraph" category with labeled emotions, syntax, and grammar at the sentence level. We can define categories for our data - raw data that might be unprocessed text or processed books after removing artifacts from OCR scanning, misspellings, etc.

Abstraction allows us to create mappings between categorical spaces, so Abstraction would consist of a collection of abstractions and the transformations between them. We have two aspects: the abstractions themselves and the transformations between those abstractions. There's also a separation between abstractions related directly to artifacts (like books) and those related to the world contained or described within the artifact itself.

The Pydantic models can be seen as operators defining equivalence classes for strings, mapping them into a semantic extraction space of categories. The effort put into game design last year is also relevant here, with abstractions grouped into entities, attributes, statements, propositions, affordances, actions, and temporal options.

While maintaining a separation between the abstractions used in creating these PIDs (Paid-ante Identifiers) is important, forcing the Goal Oriented Action Planning [[GOAP]] framework onto their creation might be problematic due to its complexity. The main challenge now is understanding the relationship between actual artifact elements like sentences and words within them and implicit artifacts evoked by text that can only be decoded by another human or a world model capable of interpreting it.

In summary, we discussed abstractions in relation to Leonardo Grant's project, maintaining order among tasks and abstractions, the desire for ultra-simplified models, language models as mappings between strings and categories, JSON strings as candidates for structured data objects, hierarchical abstractions with different levels of semantic zooming, Pydantic models defining equivalence classes for strings, game design abstractions, Goal Oriented Action Planning framework challenges, and the relationship between actual and implicit artifacts in text.
