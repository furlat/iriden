The way in which [[Entities]] can interact in our [[Abstractions]] is defined by the concept of `Affordance` which specifies the [[Attributes]] that `source` and the `target` must posses, the subset of atomic truth values, or [[Statements]], required to apply the affordance, and the subset of atomic truth values causally induced by the application of the affordance. Beyond the attribute check the `Affordance` is summarized by the prerequistes and consequences both of the form `{source: CompositeStatement, target: CompositeStatement}` .
